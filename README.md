# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-DSA-

## Introduction:
This repository serves as a collection of Python implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms. Each component is implemented in a modular and reusable manner, making it easy to understand and integrate into other projects.

## Data Structures:

### Linked List
#### Singly Linked List: 
Implements a singly linked list with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
#### Doubly Linked List: 
Implements a doubly linked list with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
### Binary Search Tree
Binary Search Tree: Implements a binary search tree with methods for insertion, search, and various traversal algorithms.
Stack
Stack: Implements a stack data structure with methods for push, pop, and printing.
Queue
Queue: Implements a queue data structure with methods for enqueue, dequeue, and printing.
Hash Table
Hash Table: Implements a hash table data structure with methods for set, get, and printing.
Graph
Graph: Implements a graph data structure with methods for adding vertices, edges, and various traversal algorithms.
Heap
Max Heap: Implements a max heap data structure with methods for insertion and removal of the maximum element.
Min Heap: Implements a min heap data structure with methods for insertion and removal of the minimum element.
Algorithms
The following algorithms are included in this repository:

Binary Search: Implements the binary search algorithm for finding elements in a sorted array.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Implements BFS for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Implements DFS for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
Usage
To use any of the data structures or algorithms provided in this repository, simply import the corresponding Python file into your project and create an instance of the class or call the function as needed. Each file contains usage examples in the form of comments or docstrings.
